# The node storage driver (STORE=node) shells out rather than speaking git
# itself: writes go through `git push` over the gitlawb remote helper, which is
# what signs them. So git, gl and git-remote-gitlawb are runtime dependencies of
# that driver, not build tools, and they are absent from a bun-alpine base. A
# driver that discovers that at the first save has already accepted the write.
#
# Pinned by version rather than fetched latest, because memlawb builds none of
# these and the signing helper is the last component that should move without
# someone choosing to move it. npm verifies the integrity of both hops: the
# wrapper's postinstall copies the binaries out of a platform package that
# @gitlawb/gl@<version> pins to that exact version, so the pin reaches the
# binaries and not just the wrapper around them.
#
# node and npm exist only to run that install, so it happens in a stage that is
# thrown away and only the two binaries are copied forward.
