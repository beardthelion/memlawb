/**
 * Delete ciphertext no visible manifest names.

 * Driven by a listing rather than by the keys this request touched, because the
 * orphans that matter are the ones no key can reach: a write that died before
 * publishing left blobs the next manifest never mentions, and a delete whose
 * collection failed removed the key from the manifest, so nothing can name its
 * hash again. Sweeping the namespace's blob directory against the live hash set
 * finds both, which is what makes `erasure: 'erases'` true rather than a claim.
 *
 * Never throws. This runs after the write is durable and collects garbage that
 * is already invisible to every reader, so a store hiccup here must not turn a
 * landed write into a failure, nor skip the caller's quota accounting.
 *
 * Single-instance only, like the lock it runs under. The sweep deletes anything
 * under the namespace's blob prefix that the manifest it just wrote does not
 * name, which is correct while one process serializes every write to that
 * namespace and silent data loss the moment two do. It moves behind the same
 * row-version check as the lock when that lands (see lock.ts and PLAN §7).
 *
 * Costs one LIST per mutating write, deliberately: it replaces a delete per
 * touched key, most of which were no-ops, and it is the only way to see an
 * orphan no key can name.
