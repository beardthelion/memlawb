/**
 * In-process keyed async lock — serializes read-modify-write critical sections
 * by string key. Correct for a SINGLE server instance; the hosted beta runs one
 * machine (fly.toml `min_machines_running = 1`) deliberately for this reason.
 * Horizontal scale moves these invariants to Postgres row-version checks
 * (PLAN §7); do not scale out before that lands.
 *
 * Shared by the namespace write path (`ns:<slug>`) and the per-owner quota
 * accounting (`owner:<id>`). Always acquire in a consistent order (ns then
 * owner) to stay deadlock-free.
