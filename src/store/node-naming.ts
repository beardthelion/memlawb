/**
 * Node store driver: naming and at-rest wrapping.
 *
 * The gitlawb node is a storage location memlawb does not control the read
 * surface of: whoever runs it can list repos, and the node publishes some of
 * what it holds. Entry blobs are already client-encrypted, so content is safe
 * there by construction. Names and metadata are not, and that is what this
 * module exists for.
 *
 * A repo named `namespaceSlug(ns)` would be enumerable: the namespace grammar is
 * low entropy (`user:alice`), so anyone holding a repo name could confirm which
 * namespace it belongs to by hashing guesses. Naming the in-repo entry leaf
 * `sha256(entryKey)` has the same shape one level down: anyone who can read a
 * repo tree could confirm the namespace holds `feedback/testing.md` by
 * precomputing one hash. So every name the node sees is an HMAC under a
 * server-held store secret, and the leaf is bound to its namespace so the same
 * entry key looks unrelated across two namespaces.
 *
 * The names must also stay injective, for the reason recorded in
 * docs/solutions/security-issues/namespace-storage-slug-injectivity.md: a lossy
 * name transform once collapsed two namespaces onto one storage segment, which
 * is a tenant-isolation break. Keyed does not buy injective on its own, so the
 * derivation takes already-injective inputs (the sha256 slug, the full entry
 * leaf) and separates its parts with a byte that cannot occur in either.
 *
 * Three fixed labels, one secret, three purposes that must never collide:
 * repo name, wrapping key, entry leaf. Rotating the secret re-paths and
 * re-wraps everything (KTD7), so it is rotatable only by migration.
 *
 * Nothing here moves key material toward the server's crypto-blind boundary.
 * The wrapping key covers the manifest and the usage record, which are stored
 * in cleartext today; entry blobs arrive already encrypted by the client and
 * are never re-wrapped, and this module has no passphrase parameter.
