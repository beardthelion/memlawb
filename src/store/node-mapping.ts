/**
 * Node store driver: store path -> node repo plus in-repo path.
 *
 * memlawb addresses everything by a flat store path; the node addresses things
 * by repo and path within it. KTD6 fixes the shape of that translation: one
 * private repo per namespace, so a repo is the unit that can be created,
 * verified private and (if it ever came to it) deleted per tenant, and one
 * shared meta repo for the two things that belong to no namespace, the owner
 * usage records and the startup probe.
 *
 * The refusal is the load-bearing part. There are exactly three path families in
 * the server today (`ns/`, `owners/`, `probe/`), no module enumerates them, and
 * a fourth added later would otherwise land in whatever branch happened to be
 * the default: the wrong repo, or a namespace repo named after a segment that is
 * not a slug. So anything this module cannot positively account for throws, and
 * the node driver fails loudly instead of writing tenant data somewhere it can
 * neither be found nor unpublished.
 *
 * Names reaching the node are keyed (see node-naming.ts), which is why the
 * in-repo leaf is derived rather than carried through: passing the store path's
 * own leaf would put a precomputable hash of an entry key in a repo tree.
 * `manifest.json` is the one literal name, and it is the same in every repo, so
 * it identifies nothing about the namespace it belongs to.
