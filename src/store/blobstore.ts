/**
 * BlobStore — the pluggable persistence interface.
 *
 * memlawb stores two things per namespace:
 *   - a `manifest` blob: JSON map of entryKey -> { hash, size, updatedAt }
 *   - one ciphertext blob per distinct entry ciphertext, named by its own hash
 *     (see `contentPath`); the manifest maps each entryKey to that hash, and two
 *     entries holding identical ciphertext share one blob
 *
 * The store only ever sees opaque bytes. It has no idea what an "entry" means
 * and could not decrypt one if it wanted to. Adapters: fs (self-host default),
 * s3 (Tigris/R2/AWS for hosted), and later ipfs / git-backed.
 *
 * Keys passed in here are already validated (see namespace.ts), so adapters
 * may use them to build paths without re-checking for traversal.
