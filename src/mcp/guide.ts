const FALLBACK = `# memlawb memory

You have durable, end-to-end-encrypted memory via the memlawb MCP tools.

- **Recall first.** At the start of a task, call \`memory_recall\` with a
  description of what you're doing before asking the user things they may have
  already told you. Act on what comes back; don't announce it.
- **Save what's durable.** When you learn a stable, reusable fact — a user
  preference, a project decision, a convention, or feedback on how to work —
  persist it with \`memory_save\`. Skip transient context and anything obvious
  from the repo. Never save secrets.
- **Maintain it.** Search before adding to avoid duplicates; update or
  \`memory_delete\` facts that are wrong or stale; keep a \`MEMORY.md\` index.

Tools: memory_save(key, content) · memory_recall(query, limit?) ·
memory_search(query) · memory_get(key) · memory_list() · memory_delete(key).`
