 * Recall's output budgets, in characters.

 * Recall is the one tool whose output size an entry author controls rather than

 * 200-char snippet, but recall returns up to `limit` bodies chosen by the
 * ranker. With entries accepted up to 250,000 bytes and `limit` reaching 20,
 * an unbounded formatter lets a crafted namespace push megabytes into the
 * agent's context through a single call. These two numbers are that bound.
 *
 * Measured over a real 301-entry store: paragraphs run 310 chars median and 766
 * at p90, heading sections 838 and 2,258, and both distributions have maxima
 * near 50,000. So the median region fits comfortably in 600 while the tail is
 * cut, which is the intended trade: the tail is where a whole-body dump would
 * have come from, and nothing is lost because every hit that gets clipped says
 * so and names the key `memory_get` returns whole.
 *
 * 4,000 in aggregate is roughly a thousand tokens, small enough that a
 * `limit`-20 recall cannot dominate a context window and large enough that the
 * default `limit` of 5 never reaches it (5 x 600 = 3,000).
