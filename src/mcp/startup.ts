/**
 * Startup preflight for the stdio MCP server.
 *
 * Why this exists: the manifest is cleartext, so a wrong or unexpanded
 * passphrase still lists keys and still saves. That first save leaves a
 * namespace written under two different keys, after which every later pull
 * fails GCM authentication for the CORRECT passphrase too. The damage is done
 * by the first tool call, so the configuration has to be checked before any
 * tool is served, and the process has to exit rather than degrade.
 *
 * It uses the reads the client already has: an authenticated hashes view of the
 * pinned namespace, then a pull when that view reports entries. No new server
 * endpoint, so this works against any deployed memlawb.
 *
 * A refusal has to name what is wrong, and naming the wrong thing has a cost
 * here that it does not have elsewhere: an operator told to change their
 * passphrase after a transient read failure is one save away from the mixed-key
 * namespace this whole file exists to prevent. So a decryption failure is
 * claimed only when the client says decryption is what failed, and a read that
 * decrypted nothing at all is reported as the server-side drift it is rather
 * than as proof of anything.
 *
 * Startup lives here rather than at server.ts's module top level so it can be
 * driven from a test without spawning a process.
 *
 * Nothing here writes to stdout. stdout is the MCP protocol channel and a
 * single stray byte on it corrupts the stream; the caller writes the returned
 * diagnostic to stderr.

/**
 * An unexpanded variable reference, in either spelling a launcher can leave
 * behind.
 *
 * openclaude substitutes an unset variable reference with its own literal text
 * and registers the server anyway, reporting only a warning, so memlawb
 * receives a non-empty passphrase that is really a template. Matching only the
 * one canonical spelling would miss every config that named the variable
 * something else. This is the only thing standing between the openclaude
 * integration and a mixed-key namespace, and that integration cannot delegate
 * the refusal upstream.
 *
 * The two rules are deliberately not symmetric, because the two spellings
 * carry different false-positive risk and a false positive here is not cheap:
 * a service key can be reissued, but a refused passphrase is the one thing
 * nobody can reissue, and the memory it opens is unreadable without it.
 *
 * BRACED matches anywhere in the value. `${` is not something `memlawb setup`
 * can generate, it is not a shape a password manager emits, and an operator who
 * genuinely wants those two characters can still choose a passphrase that
 * separates them.
 *
 * BARE is anchored to the WHOLE value and to an all-caps identifier, so it
 * means "this value is a variable reference" rather than "this value contains a
 * dollar sign". A single `$` is perfectly ordinary inside a high-entropy
 * secret, including as its first character, so anything looser would lock a
 * user out of their own memory. Refused: `$MEMLAWB_PASSPHRASE`, `$HOME`,
 * `$API_KEY_2`. Accepted: `$Xk9!vQ2m`, `pa$$word`, `$MEMLAWB_PASSPHRASE more`,
 * a lone `$`, `$4DOLLARS` (an identifier cannot start with a digit).
 *
 * What BARE knowingly does not catch, since an undocumented limit reads as
 * coverage: a lowercase or mixed-case bare reference such as `$secret` or
 * `$MyPass`. Shell and POSIX convention reserves upper case for environment
 * variables and launcher configs follow it, while `$secret` is a far more
 * plausible passphrase than an env var name, so the caps requirement is where
 * the two error costs cross over. `$` followed by a positional parameter or a
 * substitution such as `$(cmd)` is not caught either, and neither is a
 * partially expanded value.
 *
 * The residual false positive, a passphrase that really is `$` plus all caps
 * and nothing else, is recoverable: preflight gates only `memlawb mcp`, so the
 * CLI can still pull that namespace and push it again under a new passphrase.
