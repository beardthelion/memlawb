   * a server can rewrite every timestamp and nothing here detects it.
   *

   * older server, a partial map, an entry whose blob drifted), and typing it
   * as bare `string` would let a consumer index a missing key, get `undefined`
   * at runtime, and see `string` at the type level. `noUncheckedIndexedAccess`
   * is off in this project, so the union is what forces the absent case to be

/**
 * Keep only the timestamps that are safe to act on: an own string property
 * whose key is an entry we actually decrypted.
 *
 * Iterating the DECRYPTED keys rather than the server's map is what does the
 * work. A hostile or broken server can send extra keys, a prototype-polluting
 * key, a bare string, an array, or numbers instead of dates, and none of it
 * survives, because the only keys ever looked up are ones the caller already
 * holds plaintext for. That also bounds the result: the map cannot be larger
 * than the namespace, however large the response was.
 *
 * `Object.hasOwn` rather than an index test, matching the entry lookup in
 * src/mcp/tools.ts: a key like `__proto__` or `toString` must miss, never
 * resolve to something off the prototype.
 *
 * The VALUE is bounded here too, not just the key space. An earlier version
 * accepted any string and documented that callers should treat an unparseable
 * one as absent, which is the wrong place to put the rule: this function is
 * the only trust boundary the datum crosses, so every future caller would have
 * had to re-implement the same check or silently act on junk. Measured, a
 * 20,000,000-character "timestamp" passed through unaltered. A length cap plus
 * a parse check closes that by construction and costs nothing.
 *
 * Still NOT validated, and not knowable client-side: whether the server is
 * telling the TRUTH. A well-formed timestamp is accepted whatever it claims,
 * and nothing in the response authenticates it, so a hostile server can order
 * a caller's results at will within the shapes this function admits.
