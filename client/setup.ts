/**
 * Setup card — the block a first-time user pastes into an agent's MCP config.
 *
 * This lives in memlawb rather than in the onboarding console for one reason:
 * the passphrase. The console knows the user's service key and could happily
 * render a card server-side, but then the passphrase would either be generated
 * on the server or travel back to it, and the whole point of this project is
 * that neither ever happens. So the card is produced by a pure function here,
 * the console calls it client-side, and the CLI calls the same function for
 * self-hosters. The render function takes no passphrase at all: there is no
 * parameter to accidentally fill in and no value to serialize, which is the
 * mechanism, not a convention.
 *
 * Two other rules the card carries:
 *   - The namespace is pinned under the owner's own subtree, because the
 *     server grants a non-local owner exactly `user:<owner>` and its children
 *     (see authorizeNamespace in src/auth.ts). The built-in `user:me` default
 *     is unauthorized for every hosted user, so a card that omitted the
 *     namespace would fail on the first save.
 *   - The service URL must be https, since the key travels in a header. Plain
 *     http is allowed only against a loopback host, where there is no network
 *     to listen on and a self-hoster is just running the server locally.
 *
 * No module-level dependencies on purpose: this file reaches nothing that can
 * open a socket, which is what makes "the passphrase never leaves the process"
 * a structural property rather than a promise.

Paste this into your MCP config:

{
  "mcpServers": {
    "memlawb": {
      "command": "bunx",
      "args": ["-y", "@gitlawb/memlawb", "mcp"],
      "env": {
${env}
      }
    }
  }
}

Namespace. ${owner} is your whole memory, and it is the only subtree your key
can reach. For one memory set per codebase, set MEMLAWB_NAMESPACE to
${perRepo} in that repository's config. Anything outside
${owner} is refused by the server.

Passphrase. It is generated on your machine, is never sent to the service, and
cannot be recovered. Put it in MEMLAWB_PASSPHRASE above and back it up now. If
you lose it, everything stored under this account stays encrypted forever, to
you and to us alike.
