/**
 * Re-path and re-wrap a node-stored namespace under a new store secret.
 *
 * The store secret derives every node-visible name (the repo, the in-repo entry
 * leaves) and the key that wraps the manifest and usage records at rest. It
 * therefore cannot be rotated in place: a new secret means a different repo
 * holding differently-named objects under a different wrapping key. This is the
 * procedure that makes it rotatable at all, and it exists so that the answer to
 * a suspected disclosure is a runbook rather than an outage.
 *
 * What it does NOT do, deliberately: re-encrypt entry blobs. Those are
 * encrypted by the client under the user's passphrase, which this process never
 * has. They are copied byte for byte. If this script ever rewrites an entry
 * blob's bytes, that is a bug, and the verification pass below fails on it.
 *
 * Secrets are read from named environment variables, never from argv, because
 * argv is readable by any process on the box (`ps`) and this is the value that
 * names and unwraps every tenant's storage.
 *
 * The namespaces to migrate are supplied by the caller. They cannot be
 * enumerated from the node: repo names are keyed hashes of the namespace, which
 * is the property that keeps the node from learning them, so the operator
 * supplies the list from their own records.
 *
 * Run:
 *   OLD=... NEW=... bun run scripts/node-store-migrate.ts \
 *     --from-secret-env OLD --to-secret-env NEW \
 *     --namespace user:alice --namespace user:bob [--owner <ownerHash>] [--commit]
 *
 * Without --commit it reports what it would move and writes nothing.
