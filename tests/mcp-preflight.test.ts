/**
 * Startup preflight for `memlawb mcp`.
 *
 * The failure this exists to prevent: a wrong or unexpanded passphrase still
 * lists keys today, because the manifest is cleartext, and still saves. That
 * first save leaves a namespace written with two different keys, after which
 * every later pull fails GCM authentication for the CORRECT passphrase too. So
 * the interesting assertion in the undecryptable case is not "startup was
 * refused", it is "the namespace is still fully readable afterwards".
 *
 * Each defect gets its own control and each control asserts WHICH diagnostic
 * fired, not merely that something did. A preflight that refused every
 * configuration would pass a pile of one-sided refusal tests; `markerOf` below
 * makes that impossible by classifying the diagnostic into exactly one bucket,
 * and the ready-configuration tests are the negative controls beside them.
 *
 * The same rule covers the non-fatal warnings: each is asserted in both states,
 * present against a deployment that earns it and absent against one that does
 * not, because a warning emitted unconditionally passes every test that only
 * looks for it.
