/**
 * End to end over a real socket, with the gitlawb node as the store.
 *
 * `e2e-service.test.ts` drives the same surfaces over the filesystem store.
 * This exists because the node driver is the one store whose failure modes are
 * not local: it shells out, it can refuse a write for a reason no other driver
 * has (the repo is public), and it retains what a delete removes. None of that
 * is visible to a layer-local test, and the plan's verification for the driver
 * is that the MCP startup probe succeeds *through* it, which only a running
 * process can show.
 *
 * Opt-in, same switches as tests/store-node.test.ts. A run without them skips,
 * and says so, because a node suite that quietly did nothing looks exactly like
 * one that passed.
