/**
 * What a retaining store changes on the surfaces a user and a model actually
 * read (R27, R28, KTD10).
 *
 * The node driver keeps prior ciphertext in repository history and in any pin
 * already taken, so on that store a delete is not an erasure. Two consequences,
 * and neither is visible to the driver's own tests because both live in the
 * client and the tools:
 *
 *  - `memory_delete` answering a bare "deleted" is a false promise. The agent is
 *    what tells the user their memory is gone.
 *  - A non-blocking secret scan is a different bargain when the store retains.
 *    On an erasing store a warned-through credential can be deleted; here it is
 *    permanent, so the client refuses the combination before it encrypts.
 *
 * The erasure comes from the server, which reads it off the store, so nothing
 * here needs the client to know which driver is running.
